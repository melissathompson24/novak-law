         <div class="teal-block">
          <h2 id="litigation" class="fa fa-gavel fa-5x"></h2>
          <h2>Litigation</h2>         
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Litigation is an unfortunate necessity of business, often involving differing interpretations over contract provisions or allegations of wrongful actions.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">When faced with litigation, you deserve an aggressive and experienced attorney.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Mr. Novak focuses on finding the right resolution. Settlement should always be considered as a reasonable and cost efficient solution. However trials are also often necessary and require strong representation. Mr. Novak regularly appears in court for hearings and trials and has gained a reputation for passionately advocating on behalf of his clients. </p>
         </div>
        </div>


       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
         <div class="teal-block">
          <h2 id="appellate" class="fa fa-university fa-5x"></h2>
          <h2>Appellate Litigation</h2>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Novak Law's litigation experience is not limited to trials. Mr. Novak is a seasoned appellate litigator who has appeared in federal and state appellate courts throughout the country. Mr. Novak has drafted multiple successful appellate briefs in federal courts, including the Seventh Circuit, Ninth Circuit, and Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Of course Mr. Novak's experience also includes state appellate and supreme courts. Mr. Novak has successfully pursued and defended appeals before the Colorado Appellate Court and has petitioned the Colorado Supreme Court. Mr. Novak has even participated with a team in drafting an amicus curiae brief that was filed in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Success in appellate litigation requires sophisticated legal analysis, a fundamental understanding of the rules of civil procedure, and the ability to view a record objectively and with fresh ideas. Clarity and persuasiveness is vital in written and oral advocacy. Novak Law brings these skills to each appeal it handles.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
 		      <div class="teal-block">
  		      <h2 id="businessFormation" class="fa fa-gears fa-5x"></h2>
  		      <h2>Business Formation</h2>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Novak Law has extensive experience assisting clients in the creation of business entities. Creating a new business entity may be overwhelming, as there are multiple options that may or may not work for specific needs. For example, a partnership may be used by two or more individuals seeking to carry on a business for profit. However there are risks with a partnership, including the fact that each partner may be liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership.</p>
  		      <p class="text-left extra-space">Novak Law provides assistance to clients in determining what entity is best for the venture, and creating that entity in accordance with the law so that each individual is properly protected.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
         <div class="teal-block">
          <h2 id="quiet" class="fa fa-microphone-slash fa-5x"></h2>
          <h2>Quiet Title Actions</h2>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">A quiet title action is a legal action that is brought in a court to obtain final determination as to the title (ownership) of a specific piece of real property. It is often brought as a result of various individuals asserting, or possible having a right to assert, contradictory or adverse claims to the same property. In these types of suits, a quiet title action will allow the Court to determine legal rights and interests in real property, and render a final judgment as to ownership of the property in question.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Easements and property rights are all too often at issue.  Deeds may be improperly filed, or not filed at all, leading to confusion and disputes over property lines.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Mr. Novak has successfully resolved these actions, whether through settlement or judgment.</p>
         </div>
        </div>


       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
         <div class="teal-block">
          <h2 id="hoa" class="fa fa-home fa-5x"></h2>
          <h2>HOA Disputes</h2>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">Novak Law assists community associations, such as condominium associations and homeowners' associations with issues such as drafting formation documents, property management, collection of delinquent assessments, and everything in between.</p>
          <p class="text-left extra-space">However Novak Law also provides representations to individuals who have disputes with associations. Associations have strict requirements, whether through the declarations, rules, or the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act. Failure to comply with these requirements creates much larger issues, and may subject an Association to significant liability.</p>
